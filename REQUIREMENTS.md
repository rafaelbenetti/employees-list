# Rindus code challenge requirements
- Create a web application with the list of the employees by using angular 2. If you are more friendly with some other framework, please use it.

## UseCases:
- we need a list of all employees (nice to have: with search)
- we can hire a new employee and we need to register these properties:
    - name
    - surname
    - work position (we can choose from an enum, which is available on API method GET, on URL: http://ibillboard.com/api/positions)
    - date of birth
- we can change name of employee
- employee can change work position
- employee can leave the company

## Tips:
- UI must be user-friendly and easy to control (try to to use it like user)
- create unit tests, if you know how
- think about clean code and reusing code
- someone will try to run your app, think on this
